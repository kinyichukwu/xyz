#### Description:
IT'S JUST A SIMPLE E-COMMERCE APP THAT MIMICS
AMAZON. IT WAS BEAUTY ISN'T REACT NODE JS MONGO BOOTSTRAP
REDUX etc. 1001 dashboard where the admin has the ability
to add products to delete products to make another user
an admin to delete users to check the others that
have been players to check their locations and
also to scrape data from other websites like
AliExpress. Where was used for the front end of the
website data of a user's privacy previous section is stored in
the local storage of the website I use mongo DB to study data
and use node JS and its API that created with it to query data
to the mongo DB and to also remove data from it. I also use
cloudinary API to store the images that you see on the websites
which belongs to the products Google map API was also used and
location data to get the location of anyone that others for a
product. A body uses an admin can write reviews on a product
and correct the product. Also implement search
with JavaScript where is I can typing a product
they want to search for and it's Square is the
data for them. Filter was also implemented so
until corn and uncle link it will filter to the
specifications you want. Well, appertly my description is not lon enough so im going to write more about it.
#Other stuffs i used
i used axiios to connect the frontend to the backend of the website.
Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface. https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=28677054fbbdae63019152ceee3ae3b4899ffcd5bb060887cf60c92c9046127dJmltdHM9MTY1NDEyOTk4OCZpZ3VpZD1lMWUwMjYxNy1lMTY2LTRkOGQtYWIzYy0zMzVjZDEwMDUxNGUmaW5zaWQ9NTE3MQ&ptn=3&fclid=93437734-e20b-11ec-972f-698122b75a06&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9heGlvcy1odHRwLmNvbS8&ntb=1
What is the simple design for the website says it's just a normal e-commerce website that anybody can use to sell their products
on but the person I did it with wanted something more graphic like but where we ended up doing it this way so you know give us time to
think about the technical part because to be honest we found kind of stressful doing the back end of the website setting the products in the
market and all that. I record while doing this project when one area just too cold out of nowhere in the back end then we started researching
Google checking stackoverflow looking for work could have caught the error I literally had to take your course on mongo DB again to see that the
simple error was that was not connected to a very good internet connection. Is really nice doing the project with a partner because you'll be able t
o brainstorm when you have errors and also sometimes when you're not able to solve something before your partner can help you and solve it but I'm
kind of sad it does not serve any global problem. In the front and we imported some react libraries which helped us with the design for example does library called react-toastify which helped us to create a loading box that spins when the product page is still loading he gives it a better experience

#What inspired me to build the project
i built it to give to a friend as a birthday  present

#How to run the file
After downloading the repository create your
 dirty my files and get your PayPal API your
body by API key and also your cloud 9 API key
then you can learn run record shows 3000 and run
localhost 500 on the back end.
